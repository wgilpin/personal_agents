# Refactoring Summary: Removing Current Workflow Concept

## Overview

We have successfully refactored the application to remove the redundant "current_workflow" concept and consistently use workflow IDs throughout the codebase. We've also standardized terminology by using "workflow" consistently instead of mixing "workflow" and "flowchart".

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Database Layer (workflows.py)**:
   - Removed the `current_workflow_table` from `save_workflow()`
   - Removed the `load_current_workflow()` function entirely
   - Removed the `current_workflow_table` update from `update_workflow_name()`

2. **API Endpoints (api_server.py)**:
   - Removed the `/flowchart/current/execute` endpoint
   - Renamed imports to avoid naming conflicts
   - Updated endpoint names to use consistent "workflow" terminology
   - Fixed the `update_workflow_name` endpoint to properly handle the function call

### Frontend Changes

1. **App.vue**:
   - Added `currentWorkflowId` to track workflows by ID instead of just name
   - Updated the `startWorkflow` method to use the workflow ID
   - Updated the `publishWorkflow` method to use the new `/workflows` endpoint
   - Standardized terminology by using "workflow" consistently instead of "flowchart"
   - Fixed the workflow execution data fetching to use the workflow ID

2. **WorkflowModal.vue**:
   - Removed filtering of "current_flowchart.yaml" from the list of workflows
   - Updated to work with the workflow ID consistently

3. **Toolbar.vue**:
   - Updated the title from "Flowchart Builder" to "Workflow Builder"
   - Updated button IDs and event names from "flowchart" to "workflow"
   - Updated CSS classes and IDs accordingly

### Test Changes

1. **test_api_server.py**:
   - Removed references to the `current_workflow_table`
   - Updated tests to use the new endpoints
   - Fixed the mock responses to match the implementation

2. **test_workflow_execution.py**:
   - Removed references to the `current_workflow_table`
   - Updated tests to use the new endpoints
   - Fixed the mock responses to match the implementation

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Simplified Data Model**: Single source of truth for workflows
2. **Reduced Complexity**: No need to keep multiple copies in sync
3. **Consistent Terminology**: Using "workflow" consistently throughout the codebase
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Cleaner code that's easier to understand and modify
5. **Better Scalability**: Removal of global state makes the application more suitable for multi-user scenarios

## Backward Compatibility

We've maintained backward compatibility by:
1. Keeping the workflow ID format the same
2. Ensuring the API responses have the same structure
3. Preserving the check that prevents deletion of "current_flowchart" (for backward compatibility)

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation Update**: Update any documentation to reflect the new terminology and workflow-based approach
2. **User Training**: Inform users about the consistent use of "workflow" terminology
3. **Future Improvements**: Consider further refactoring to make the workflow ID generation more robust
